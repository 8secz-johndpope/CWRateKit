## Installation

### CocoaPods:

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `CWRateKit` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'CWRateKit'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate `CWRateKit` into your Xcode project using Xcode 11, specify it in `File > Swift Packages > Add`:

```ogdl
https://github.com/clockworkone/CWRateKit
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate `CWRateKit` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "clockworkone/CWRateKit"
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of dependency managers, you can integrate `CWRateKit` into your project manually. Put `CWRateKit` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.
